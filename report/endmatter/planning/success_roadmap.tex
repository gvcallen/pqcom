Skripsie Success Roadmap
"Success is not final; failure is not fatal: It is the courage to continue that counts"

05 Thursday         Antenna size planning and simulation; zero-sensor reference implemented; mount is stable with bolts;
06 Friday           Motor pointing given angles as input; motor drive is simulatenous and consistent;
07 Saturday         Cross-scan implemented; Conical scanning implemented
08 Sunday           Antenna size increased; antenna matching strip improved; antenna ground plane cut and cupped
09 Monday           Protocol implemented on GS, PQ and PC; Initial control software interface developed
10 Tuesday          Control software flight-path uploading implemented; flight path tracking implemented 
11 Wednesday        Radiosonde reverse engineering investigated
12 Thursday         GS IMU and GPS system implemented; compass and magdec working; mount pointing given location input
13 Friday           PocketQube soldered; PQ unit hardware tested with battery; final parts ordered 
14 Saturday         Link parameters experimented with; baud rate measurement; initial range testing and parameter confirmation for short link
15 Sunday           Radiosonde reverse engineering implemented in SDR
16 Monday           Radiosonde reverse engineering implemented in interface

This project would not have been possible without a few acknowledgements. I would sincerely like to thank:
\begin{itemize}
    \item My supervisor, Dr Barnard, for his input and support throughout the project.
    \item Mr Peter Roux, for being very helpful and allowing me to test my system on the South African Weather Service balloons.
    \item My parents, Charleen and Spencer, both for the emotional support that they provided me when stress levels were high, and for the practical support they provided, including driving long distances to test locations far away.
    \item My friends, for the laughter and support, especially Bevan, who has been a backbone for me while we both worked on our Skripsies together.
\end{itemize}

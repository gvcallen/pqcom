Mount stress test (currents @ 12.3V)
    - 20 000 us step delay. Calibrate-return to stow cycle conducted 10 times. Minimum stable current of 0.848 and maximum 1.140. No slippage noticed.
    - 10 000 us step delay. Minimal slippage. 0.757 A minimum stable. Mount drops slightly before calibration
    - 5 000 us step delay. A lot of slippage noticed. Minimum stable current around 0.45. Mount unable to return to stowed position

Left for 1 hour at 80 degrees elevation at 2/3 current. Current found to be 0.91 before, 0.92 30 minutes, and 0.92 after 1 hour
Left for 1 hour at 70 degrees elevation at 3/3 current. Current found to be 2.21 before, 2.33 30 minutes, and 2.44 after 1 hour
15:20 start

Slippage noticed at 30 degree elevation for 2/3 current. Rotated 60 degrees azimuthal and observed. Slippage occurs inconsistently e.g. 7th and 24th rotation.
3/3 current necessary for low angles.

\section{PocketQube Unit}

Since the components have been selected, the design of the PQ unit PCB can be done. This unit includes the microcontroller, integration with the PQ9 9-pin bus, and control of the GPS and RF modules.

The bus requires one unit of the PocketQube to control the reset line. This will need to be included in the RF unit so that the entire PQ can be reset via a tele-command. This, however, introduces complications in that the PQ9 specification requires the reset line to be driven for at least 20 ms, whereas the ATmega328 will reset after a \SI{2.5}{\micro \second} pulse.

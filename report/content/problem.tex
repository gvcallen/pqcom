\chapter{Problem Definition}

\section{Requirements}

The requirements for this project are defined by analysing general existing balloon-satellite systems, as well as taking into account the planned launch that this specific PQ will be used in. In these systems, the high-altitude balloons can drift to a height of around 30 km \cite{weatherWeatherBalloons}.

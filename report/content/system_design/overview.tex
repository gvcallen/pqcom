\section{Overview}
This chapter encompasses the system-level design. The approach is to make design choices that allow for modularity with regards to component integration and testing. The specific details of the circuit design and interconnects will be not be discussed, however initial high-level design choices will be made. This include decisions for the overall system, the PocketQube unit, and the ground station unit.

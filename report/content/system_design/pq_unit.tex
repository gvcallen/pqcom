A block diagram of the system components for the PocketQube unit is shown in Figure \ref{fig:pqunit_system}. This unit is relatively simple in comparison to the ground station. The unit consists of an RF section, and a GPS section. The system will be powered via the +3V3 on the PocketQube bus. An integrated GPS module, as well as RF module, should be included. Further, an RS-485 line transceiver should be included to cater for the PQ standard's RS-485 bus, which will likely connect to the MCU via UART.

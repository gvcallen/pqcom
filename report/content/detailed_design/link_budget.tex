\section{Link Budget}

The link budget should now be conducted, and initial considerations for the ground station's base location should be made, as this location will affect the range of elevation angles to accomodate, the distance to the horizon, and the free-space path loss.

Signal Hill in Cape Town is a viable location for the ground station and is easily accessible. At its distance of 114 km, however, one would need to be at a height of 950 m due to the distance to the horizon. Therefore, the balloon would only be visible at an altitude of 600 m (from Signal Hill's 350 m height). A maximum elevation angle of $16.72 \circ$ at 30 km altitude above Worcester should be considered.

The \textit{receiver sensitivity} is a value which denotes the minimum power level required at the receiver for successful communication. Depending on set parameters, the SX1278 quotes varying receiver sensitivity values. Notable configurations are listed in Table \ref{tab:sensitivity_values}.

An online path loos calculator was used to attenuation due to distance, and the Python tool \textit{link budget} was used to calculate atmospheric losses. All values were based on the RA-02's internal SX1278 chip and its specifications, half-wavelength dipoles as antennas, an impedance mismatch loss of 0.5 dB (around -10 dB return loss), and an equivalent transmitter power of 100 mW (20 dBm). The resultant link margin should then be analysed accordingly, and an appropriate directive antenna designed for the ground station, to ensure adequate fade margin and performance. The LoRa "target bit rate" sensitivity value of -119 dBm is used in this budget.

The final link budget therefore results in 17.65 dBm - 129.89 dB + 119.65 dBm = 7.41 dB of link margin. Although this is theoretically adequate (above the 3 dB recommendation), there are a few considerations to be made:
\begin{itemize}
    \item If a higher bit rate is required, e.g. 38.4 kbps, then the margin drops to -2.59 dB.
    \item If a longer range is required (e.g. for future projects), free space path loss will drastically increase. For example, for a 250 km range, the loss becomes 133 dB, meaning the margin drops to only 1.11 dB.
\end{itemize}

To achieve the 10 dB recommended margin, an antenna with at least 2.59 dBi additional gain (i.e. 4.74 dBi total) should be designed for the ground station. Then, if necessary, the 20 dB recommendation can be reached by lowering the LoRa spreading factor (SF) to support any "mission critical" requirements. Practically, this could be set as the system "startup" state, until a link is made, where the SF can then be changed.

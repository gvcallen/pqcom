\section{PocketQube Unit PCB}

As mentioned, it was decided that a balloon satellite would not be flown by the E\&E department. Therefore, integration with the other PocketQube modules was not prioritised for the PCB and the RS-485 line drivers were not soldered onto the board. Current consumption for the rest of the components, however, was measured at 31 mA when the system was directly powered from a power supply running at 3.3 V. This is only 6 mA lower than the total current expected from the GPS and MCU ICs, indicating conformance to the original design.

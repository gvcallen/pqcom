\section{PocketQube Unit Antenna}

The return loss of the dipole antenna is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dipoleReturnLoss}. It is clear that the resulting match is successful. Since frequencies from 420 to 440 MHz provide less than 0.1 dB mismatch loss, a final system frequency of around $\SI{430}{MHz}$ can be selected, chosen solely based on the helical antenna's return loss.

\section{PocketQube Unit Antenna}

The return loss of the PQ dipole antenna is shown in Figure \ref{fig:dipoleReturnLoss}. It is clear that, due to the antenna's simple construction, the resulting match is near-perfect. Since frequencys from around 420 to 440 MHz provide less than 0.1 dB mismatch loss, the final system frequency will be determined by the helical antenna only.

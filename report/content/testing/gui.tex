\section{GUI}

The interface was developed and tested to ensure that it could control the mount, and receive telemetry readings from both the LoRa and Radiosonde links. An example of the output received on the GUI's monitor is shown in Figure \ref{fig:guiOpenLoop}, after the calibration button was pressed; flight path data was uploaded; the tracking method was set to open-loop (``GPS Uploaded"); and the system was left for some time. Further outputs are given in Appendix .

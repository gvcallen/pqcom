\section{GUI}

The interface was tested to ensure that it met the desired functionality. An example of the output received on the GUI's monitor is shown in Figure \ref{fig:guiOpenLoop}, after the calibration button was pressed; flight path data was uploaded; the tracking method was set to open-loop (``GPS Uploaded"); and the system was left for some time. Further outputs, as well as the whole interface, are shown in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_gui}.

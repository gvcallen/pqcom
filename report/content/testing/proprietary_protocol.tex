\section{Radiosonde Protocol}

The custom helical antenna was connected to the RTL-SDR software-defined radio and the radiosonde signal was successfully received.

\textcolor{red}{I still plan to add a figure of the received data. I also am now investigating the protocol in attempt to find GPS co-ordinates. Otherwise if I want to do the full system and I cannot access these co-ordinates, I will be able to only test open-loop tracking}

\section{Full System}

The South African Weather Service fortunately granted permission for tracking of their weather balloons, which contain similar Radiosondes as designed for. A full system test was therefore conducted, with closed-loop tracking being prioritised. The system was found to successfully track and receive the Radiosonde's GPS location up to a distance of 50 km. It should be noted that, since the Radiosonde's receiver has a low sensitivity, a range as long as the custom link is not expected. However, this full system test successfully demonstrates the capabilities of the system. An image of the setup is shown in Figure \textcolor{red}{xxx}.

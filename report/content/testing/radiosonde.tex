\section{Radiosonde}

The helical antenna was setup to receive the radiosonde GFSK signal using the RTL-SDR USB dongle. A resultant "squelch" signal was observed to be received in one second intervals, and the frequency domain of this signal is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:radiosondeSpectrum} using GNU Radio software.

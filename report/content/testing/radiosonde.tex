\section{Radiosonde}

The helical antenna was setup to receive signal from a testing iMet-54 radiosonde using the RTL-SDR USB dongle and an SMA-MCX adapter. A resultant one-second squelch signal shown in Figure \ref{fig:radiosondeSpectrum} was observed. A free Python script \textit{Auto-RX} \cite{site-autoRX} was found which caters for several radiosonde types. This was used to retrieve the GPS location successfully.

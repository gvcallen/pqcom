\section{Radiosonde}

The helical antenna was setup to receive the radiosonde GFSK signal using the RTL-SDR USB dongle. A resultant "squelch" signal was observed to be received by the radiosonde in one second intervals, and the frequency domain of this signal is shown in Figure \ref{fig:radiosondeSpectrum}.

\textcolor{red}{Hopefully I can decode this signal to at least get GPS location, otherwise an open-loop test might still be useful?}

\section{Radiosonde}

The helical antenna was setup to receive signal from a test iMet-54 radiosonde using the RTL-SDR USB dongle and an SMA to MCX adapter. A resultant "squelch" signal was observed to be received in one second intervals, and the frequency domain of this signal is plotted in Figure \ref{fig:radiosondeSpectrum} using GNU Radio software. A free Python script \textit{Auto-RX} was found to cater for receiving telemetry from this radiosondes, as well as several others, and the GPS location was successfully received.

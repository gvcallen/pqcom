\section{Ground Station PCB}

The ground station PCB was manufactured in-house. A figure of the PCB with components assembled, as well as a helical antenna attached for initial development, and a simple monopole GPS antenna, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:groundStationPCB}. Due to a few incorrect layouts on the PCB, some additional wired connections were made. A list of errata for both PCBs can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_pcb_errata}.

\section{Ground Station PCB}

The ground station PCB was manufactured in-house. A figure of the PCB with components assembled, as well as a helical antenna attached for initial development, and a monopole GPS antenna, is shown in Figure \ref{fig:groundStationPCB}. Some additional wired connections were made to due layout errors. A list of errata can be found in Appendix \ref{sec:appendix_pcb_errata}.

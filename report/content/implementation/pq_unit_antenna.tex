\section{PocketQube Unit Antenna}

The PQ unit antenna was simply implemented using readily available 1.5 mm steel wire. The wire was bent by hand, and the end of u.FL pigtail cable was stripped and soldered to the wire. Lastly, insulation tape was added near the connection for stability and protection. The final design can be found in Figure \ref{fig:pqAntenna}.

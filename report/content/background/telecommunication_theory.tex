\section{Telecommunication Theory}\label{sec:telecommunication_theory}
A review of the communication techniques used for wireless links is conducted below. Since it is already planned to use modular components in the hardware design stage, and most modules handle error correction, modulation, demodulation and more with little effort, only a brief overview is given.

\subsection{Modulation Techniques}
The \textit{modulation} technique used over a communication link essentially refers to the method used to encode analog or digital information into an electrical voltage. The following techniques are commonly used in satelllite communication:
